## Building Cake.Transifex

### 1. Building on Windows
The following are needed to build Cake.Transifex on Windows
- .NET Core 1.0.1
- Visual Studio 2017
- .NET 4.5 (.NET 4.5.2 to build the unit tests), *these should already be installed when installing Visual Studio 2017*

Open up a powershell window and call `.\build.ps1`, this should build the projects, run the unit tests and create nuget packages in the `.\artifacts\v{version}\nuget` directory.

### 2. Building on Linux or OSX
- .NET Core 1.0.1
- Mono (uncertain of which version, and it may fail on some systems)

Open up the terminal and call `sh build.sh`, this should build the projects, run the unit tests and create nuget packages in the `./artifacts/v{version}/nuget` directory.
**NOTE: By default we do not enable building of .NET Full on Linux and OSX, to also build .NET Full pass `--with-netfull` when calling `sh build.sh`**
